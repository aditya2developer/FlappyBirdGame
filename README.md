# FlappyBirdGame
This is a desktop version of the classic Flappy Bird game built using Java Swing and AWT. The game features simple 2D graphics, smooth controls, and responsive gameplay mechanics. The player controls a bird that must fly between sets of pipes without hitting them. Each successful pass through a pipe increases the score.
